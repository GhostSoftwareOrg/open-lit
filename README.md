# OpenLit
OpenLit is an open-source format and generator for textbooks and educational literature.

## Purpose
There is a need for a centralized format to describe textbooks. While [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) allows this, it is usually unnecessarily verbose for most pegagogical media. OpenLit provides a customizable style while attaining complete standardization and human-readable notation.
