# OpenLit Standard v1.0

This is the Markdown resource for the OpenLit Standard (1.0).

## Preamble

### Notation

This document uses various notation to describe the OpenLit notation in unambigous completeness. To remain completely unambigious, a description of the notation used is
relevant. The set of all characters within a given document $D_n$ is $D^{\star}_n$.


For a given subset (match-case), we say the primary matching function $m_{\phi}({D^\star_n}) \in D^{\star}_n$ returns
the start and end indexes of the first set of characters which match the restrictrion expression $\phi$. 
If we then create an $k$-th set $D^{\star}_{n, k}$

#### Regular Expressions

Assume all Regular Expressions as [Perl Compatible Regular Expressions](https://pcre.org).
